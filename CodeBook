#The name of the resulting tidy dataset after runnign the r script in the read me file is result.txt.
#To run the script thta produce the data the only thing you need to do is modify the path to the UCI HAR Dataset folder on
your computer
#after running the script the file will be in the UCI HAR Dataset folder on your computer

----------------------------------------------------
#the variable in the dataset are the following:
1. Activity
*possible values are : WALKING,WALKING_UPSTAIRS,WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,SITTING,STANDING,LAYING,NOT CLASSIFIED
2. Var_type: type of the feature, possible values are all the feature containing "mean" and "std" in the original data
3. MeanValue: Average of the corresponding feature by activity 

----------------------------------------------------

The step in the script processing the data are the following:

step 1 read X_train data
step 1 read features data
step 1 assign column names of the feature to the x_train dataset
step 1 read y_train data
step 1 assign column names of the feature to the y_train dataset
step 1 read subject train data
step 1 assign column names f_subject to the subject data
step 1 merge the train data
step 2
 execute the same steps on the test data
step 3 merge the train and test data
step 4 assign meaningful activity names using the mapping from the file activity_labels
step 5 calculating allowed column (only column containing "mean" and "std" in the name)
step 6 filtering the data only for the allowed column 
step 7 load reshape2 and plyr package
step 8 melt the data to make it tydy in long format
step 9  grouping the data aggregating on activity and type of feature
step 10 assign final column names 
step 11 write the tidy dataset to the folder UCI HAR Dataset with name result.txt

All this steps are commented in the script
